# Last Stats
Last Stats will be an android app that shows you fun last.fm statistics pulled from a last.fm account. You can gain insight into your own listening habits or you can stalk your friends to see their tendencies. 

# Schedule
Last Stats is currently in the early stages of development. Currently the framework is being set up and preminary stress tests against the Last.FM api is being done. The next phase is to introduce the first wave of functionalities with a simple UI and release the early version onto the Play Store. 

The tentative goal is to release a usable early version with limited statistics and presentation elements as a proof-of-concept. This version is scheduled to be released prior to October 2015. 

# Monetization
Last FM prohibits monetization using their api without written consent. As such the app is planed to be be offered for free on Google Play.
